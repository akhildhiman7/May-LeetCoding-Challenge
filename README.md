May LeetCoding Challenge is a Daily coding challenge organized by Leetcode
in the month of May in 2020. It can be accesed at https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/may-leetcoding-challenge/

I have written Solution for most of the problems in Python. Because I just love Python and some are available in C++ as we
all know that Old is gold (No other language can provide better support for handling hierarchical Data Structures e.g. Tree, Linked List, Trees, etc)
But if anyone is having difficult to understand the logic or want to have the solution in another language please feel free to contact to me at dakhil655@gmail.com I'd be happy to resolve your dbout. ðŸ¤

Happy LeetCoding!! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’™
